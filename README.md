#MoveBallJS

#Description: 
This exercise is from my into to HTML, CSS + JS course through MITxPRO. I wrote code to create a ball and make it move across the page in a diagonal across the x- and y- axis. 
The ball bounces back and changes to a random color when it recognizes the edge of its container.
